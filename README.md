# Logstash
Skills test repository for Logstash files


## The Requirements
The requirements for this skills test are:
1) Provide the Logstash configuration on a public Git repo.
2) Write a short description of how data is ingested and output from Logstash based on my solution.


## VM configuration and initial setup
I created a cloud VM running Ubuntu 20.04 for this exercise. After spinning up the VM, I installed Elasticsearch and Logstash.
The instructions can be found at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/installing-logstash.html.
